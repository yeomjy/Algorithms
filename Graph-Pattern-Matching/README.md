# Graph Pattern Matching Challenge

This directory is archive of "Graph Pattern Matching Challenge" assignment of Algorithm lecture(4190.407), 2021 Spring.

***You may use basic pruning techniques, but since the challenge aims to find a good matching order, you are not expected to use complicated pruning techniques (like Failing Set of DAF).***
## Compile and Execute 
### main program
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main/program <data graph file> <query graph file> <candidate set file>
```
### executable program that outputs a candidate set
```
./executable/filter_vertices <data graph file> <query graph file>
```
